# CS300_Data_Compression

In this project I implemented an algorithm for data compression. The
purpose of data compression is to take a file A and, within a reasonable amount of
time, transform it into another file B in such a way that: (i) B is smaller than A, and
(ii) it is possible to reconstruct A from B. A program that converts A into B is called
a compressor, and one that undoes this operation is called an uncompressor. Popular
programs such as WinZip perform this function, among others. Compressing data
enables us to store data more efficiently on our storage devices or transmit data faster
using communication facilities since fewer bits are needed to represent the actual
data.
